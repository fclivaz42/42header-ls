# **42 Header for Lausanne**

42 | Lausanne

### **Description**

42 standard header for the (neo)vim editor, tuned for Lausanne :)

Go read the [original](https://github.com/42Paris/42header) to see how it works!
I changed a line so that it displays "LAUSANNE.CH". It might have a few other added features that I will try to upstream as much as I can.
